Stereo camera calibration with QT and openCV, using stereo pairs (PNG, TIF, JPG) or stereo MPO images

I didn't find any simple tool (understand: GUI) to calibrate my lens for stereo photography. So why not writing it myself ?
I'm not an ace of C++ and QT, in fact I started about one month ago, so if you don't find my code pretty, never mind, because it WORKS, and that's all I'm asking of it :)
